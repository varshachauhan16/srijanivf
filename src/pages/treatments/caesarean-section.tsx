              A C-section, also known as cesarean delivery, is a surgical
              procedure where the baby is delivered through an incision made
              in the mother’s abdomen and uterus. It’s typically performed
              when a vaginal delivery is not considered safe for the mother,
              baby, or both.

            <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-5">
              The cost of a C-section in Delhi can vary depending on several
              factors. Public hospitals are generally less expensive than
              private hospitals. Choosing a private room will also increase
              the cost. The experience and qualifications of the surgeon can
              influence the cost, as can the type of anesthesia used
              (general vs. spinal). Additional medications or specific
              equipment used during the surgery can also affect the overall
              cost.

            <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
              There are various reasons why a C-section might be recommended
              by your doctor:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-gray-600 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">

              <li>
                <strong>Fetal distress:</strong> If the baby shows signs of
                distress during labor, a C-section might be necessary for a
                safe delivery.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Breech position:</strong> If the baby is positioned
                feet-first or sideways in the birth canal, a C-section may
                be safer.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Placenta previa:</strong> When the placenta covers
                the cervix, a C-section is essential for safe delivery.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Multiple pregnancy:</strong> In some cases of twins,
                triplets, or more babies, a C-section might be recommended.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Previous C-section:</strong> If you’ve had a
                previous C-section, the type of incision made and your
                doctor’s assessment will determine if a vaginal birth (VBAC)
                is possible or if a C-section is recommended.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Maternal health concerns:</strong> Certain
                pre-existing medical conditions in the mother might
                necessitate a C-section for a safe delivery.
              </li>

            </ul>

            <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Remember:</strong> A C-section is a major surgery.
              While it’s a safe and effective option for childbirth in
              certain situations, discussing all birthing options with your
              doctor and understanding the reasons behind a recommended
              C-section is crucial for making informed decisions about your
              delivery.
