                <strong>Age:</strong> Being very young (under 17) or older

              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Advanced monitoring:</strong> Utilize specialized

              <li>
                <strong>Collaboration with other specialists:</strong> Work

              <li>
                <strong>Reduced risk of complications:</strong> Early
