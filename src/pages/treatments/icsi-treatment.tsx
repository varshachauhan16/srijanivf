    q: "1. ICSI vs IVF: Which is better?",
    a: (
      <>
        There isn't necessarily a "better" option between ICSI and IVF. The
        most suitable technique depends on the specific situation of the couple.
        Here's a breakdown:
        <br />
        <br />
        • <strong>ICSI:</strong> This is recommended for male factor
        infertility, such as low sperm count, poor motility, or blockages
        preventing sperm from reaching the egg.
        <br />
        <br />
        • <strong>IVF:</strong> This is a broader infertility treatment suitable
        for various situations, including female factor infertility,
        unexplained infertility, or issues with fertilization in previous
        cycles.
      </>
    ),
  },

  {
    q: "2. Can ICSI be done with donor sperm?",
    a: "Yes, ICSI can be successfully performed using donor sperm. This can be an option for couples with male factor infertility where the male partner cannot provide healthy sperm for fertilization.",
  },

  {
    q: "3. Is ICSI success rate higher than IVF?",
    a: "ICSI can have a higher fertilization rate compared to conventional IVF, particularly in cases with severe male factor infertility. However, it's important to remember that fertilization is just one step in the IVF process. Overall success rates (pregnancy and live birth) depend on various factors like egg quality, embryo development, and the woman's age and health.",
  },

  {
    q: "4. What are the alternatives to ICSI?",
    a: "There are alternative treatments like IUI (insemination) or ovulation medication, depending on the cause of infertility. Your doctor can advise on the most suitable option.",
  },

                Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), pronounced
                ik-see, is a specialized technique used during in vitro
                fertilization (IVF) to improve the chances of fertilization.
                Unlike conventional IVF where sperm fertilizes the egg naturally,
                ICSI injects a single healthy sperm directly into the mature
                egg’s cytoplasm.

              is a general estimate, and the actual cost may differ. Discussing
              the cost breakdown with your chosen fertility clinic during the
              consultation process is essential. Some clinics might offer
              bundled packages that include ICSI, or they may have financing
