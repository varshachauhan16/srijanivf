              In vitro fertilization, commonly referred to as IVF, is a beacon of hope for many couples
              facing infertility. As a type of assisted reproductive technology (ART), IVF helps individuals
              and couples achieve parenthood by fertilizing eggs with sperm outside the body (in vitro) and
              then transferring the resulting embryos to the uterus for implantation and pregnancy.

              The IVF journey, a path to parenthood for many couples struggling with infertility, can be
              broken down into several key stages. The first step involves a consultation and evaluation with
              a fertility specialist. During this initial meeting, you'll have the opportunity to discuss
              your fertility concerns, medical history, and desired outcomes. The specialist will likely
              recommend a battery of tests for both partners to assess your individual fertility potential.
              These tests may include blood tests to check hormone levels and sperm quality, and ultrasounds
              for the woman to evaluate ovulation and uterine health.

              The cost of IVF treatment in India can vary significantly depending on several factors,
              including the chosen clinic, location, and specific procedures required. In 2026, a single
              IVF cycle in India typically ranges from ₹1,00,000 to ₹3,50,000 (approximately $1,200 to
              $4,200 USD). This cost excludes medication, which can add another ₹30,000 to ₹50,000
              (approximately $360 to $600 USD). Additional services like intracytoplasmic sperm injection
              (ICSI), preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), or embryo freezing can further increase the
              overall expense.

              Understanding the cost structure is essential for planning your IVF journey. At Srijan IVF,

              The success rates of in vitro fertilization (IVF) can vary widely depending on numerous
              factors. Generally, the live birth rate per IVF cycle ranges from 35% to 50%, but individual
              success can be influenced by age, with younger women typically experiencing higher success
              rates. Other critical factors include the underlying causes of infertility, embryo quality,
              and the experience of the fertility clinic. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol
              consumption, and weight also play a significant role. Additionally, the use of advanced
              techniques like preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) can improve outcomes by ensuring the
              transfer of genetically viable embryos.
