              is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus
              (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. This misplaced tissue
              can be found on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, intestines, or
              other pelvic tissues. Endometriosis can cause pain,
              especially during menstruation, and may also lead to fertility
              issues.

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-gray-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">

              <li>
                <strong>Retrograde Menstruation –</strong> When menstrual
                blood flows backward into the pelvic cavity instead of
                exiting the body.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Genetic Factors –</strong> Women with a family
                history of endometriosis are at a higher risk of developing
                the condition.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Immune System Dysfunction –</strong> A weakened
                immune system may fail to detect and eliminate
                endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Hormonal Influence –</strong> Estrogen plays a key
                role in the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Surgical Scarring –</strong> Previous surgeries,
                such as a C-section, may allow endometrial cells to implant
                and grow outside the uterus.
